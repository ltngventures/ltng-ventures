            Bitcoin's Promise
        </h2>

        <p>
            Bitcoin is the next logical progression in our monetary evolution, fundamentally
            re-architecting the traditional monetary network to become more efficient, cheap, and
            open. This culminates in history's most secure, resilient, censorship-resistant monetary
            network. With its robust security, irreversible transactions, permissionless nature,
            distributed network, and capacity for instant borderless micropayments, Bitcoin is
            disrupting the global financial system and redefining property rights while financially
            empowering users worldwide and has already become essential in many emerging markets,
            serving as a store of value and a medium of exchange.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bitcoin's free and open-source protocol is immune to the capture and influence of any
            government, company, or group. Traditional and non-traditional currencies or assets,
            such as the US dollar or Ethereum, are susceptible to manipulation by central banks or
            other entities and groups of people, rendering them less liquid and portable than they
            would otherwise be. Ultimately subjecting their users to disenfranchisement and monetary
            debasement by the rule of a few. By maintaining possession of Bitcoin private keys,
            individuals can effectively eliminate the potential risks associated with third-party
            involvement at the protocol level.

            Our Investment Thesis
        </h2>

        <p>
            Bitcoin is a fundamentally transformative technology disrupting traditional financial
            systems, driving financial inclusion, and enabling a new era of tech innovation. We aim
            to capitalize on this opportunity by investing in promising Bitcoin-native startups
            poised to redefine their respective industries.

            Investment Focus
        </h2>

        <p>
            Our investment focus includes Bitcoin infrastructure, payment solutions and financial
            services, and innovative applications built on Bitcoin. We will invest in companies
            developing foundational technologies and services that benefit from and support the
            Bitcoin ecosystem, such as mining operations, financial empowerment tools, node
            infrastructure, wallet solutions, and free and open-source technologies. Some areas of
            particular interest are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Lightning Network:</strong> We seek to support startups building tools, products,
                and services that leverage the Lightning Network to enable fast, low-cost, and scalable
                Bitcoin transactions. We believe that the Lightning Network will be crucial for mainstream
                adoption and fuel the next wave of innovative applications and use cases for Bitcoin.
                Startups in this sector can potentially drive mass adoption of Bitcoin as a payment and
                value transfer method.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Financial Products, Services & Inclusion:</strong> We are keen to support startups
                that leverage Bitcoin's unique properties to provide financial services to banked, unbanked,
                and underbanked populations. On-ramps, off-ramps, and neo-banks, led by those striving
                and driving for global financial inclusion, individual empowerment, bridging the gap
                between traditional finance, and building the Hyperbitcoinized future. Bitcoin has the
                potential to serve more than 1.7 billion unbanked people. We are interested in startups
                leveraging the Bitcoin network to facilitate fast, secure, low-cost payment processing,
                remittance use cases, and other financial services. This includes lending, estate planning,
                insurance, retirement accounts, and corporate enterprise benefits.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Privacy, Security & Telecommunications:</strong> We prioritize investments in
                startups that enhance Bitcoin's privacy and security features, making the network more
                robust and user-friendly. Security and privacy improvements will increase Bitcoin's adoption
                and market penetration. These innovations will contribute significantly to ushering in
                the Consumer Bitcoin era. Eliminating technical misunderstandings or other frictions
                fuels the ecosystem's demand and value. Secure communications, micropayments, and the
                telecommunications industry are also ripe for Bitcoin disruption.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Decentralized applications (dApps):</strong> We will support innovative projects
                built exclusively on the Bitcoin protocol stack, such as decentralized, permissionless
                markets, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, wallet infrastructure, tokenized assets
                on Bitcoin layers or sidechains, and other emerging applications.

            The Market Opportunity
        </h2>

        <p>
            The rapid growth of the Bitcoin market, increasing institutional interest, and the
            emergence of new use cases present significant opportunities for investment in the
            Bitcoin ecosystem. The total market capitalization of Bitcoin has grown exponentially
            since its inception, reaching over $1 trillion in 2021 and demonstrating the potential
            for further growth and adoption.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bitcoin's network effect is becoming increasingly evident, making this an opportune time
            to invest in Bitcoin-related startups. As more businesses and individuals recognize the
            potential of Bitcoin, the demand for innovative products and services in this space will
            continue to grow exponentially.
        </p>

        <p>
            Major financial institutions, corporations, and investors increasingly recognize
            Bitcoin's value as a long-term investment and store of value, driving more capital into
            the ecosystem. Consider the following stats for Bitcoin startups in 2022, deep in a bear
            market driven by the fastest tightning cycle in over 40 years:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of funding rounds increased by over 50%</li>
            <li>
                The number of unique companies funded grew by 70%, with seed funding deals up over
                130%!
            </li>
            <li>
                Total capital raised in 2022 was $343,000,000, compared to $301,000,000 in 2021
                (+14%).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We're still early. Growth in founding and funding of Bitcoin startups continues is
            accelerating. <a href="/investors">Ready to invest?</a>
